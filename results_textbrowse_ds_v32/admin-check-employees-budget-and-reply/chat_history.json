Platform Access:**\n- Successfully accessed Rocket.Chat workspace at http://the-agent-company.com:3000/home\n- Successfully accessed ownCloud platform at http://the-agent-company.com:8092\n\n**2. Department Manager Investigation:**\n- **Chen Xinyi (HR)**: Located in user directory, accessed direct messages, no equipment requests found\n- **Huang Jie (Product)**: Located in user directory, searched product and general channels, no equipment requests found\n- **Jessica Lee (Marketing)**: Not found in user directory, cannot be located\n\n**3. File Location:**\n- Successfully navigated to \"Administrative Specialist\" folder in ownCloud\n- Located \"products.pdf\" file (65.9 MB, recently modified)\n\n### **\u274c WHAT REMAINS BLOCKED:**\n\n**1. Equipment Requests Collection:**\n- No equipment requests found from any department managers in Rocket.Chat\n- Jessica Lee cannot be located in the system\n- All searched channels (sales-marketing, product, hr-announcements, general) show no historical messages\n\n**2.

Extract equipment prices from products.pdf\n2. Assume standard equipment requests based on department needs\n3. Calculate budget scenarios for common equipment combinations\n4.
