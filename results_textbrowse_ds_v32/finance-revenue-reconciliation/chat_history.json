Extract and analyze the data\n2. Compare revenue recognition schedules with contract values\n3. Identify discrepancies in revenue timing or amounts\n4. Create the `flagged_contracts.xlsx` report\n5. Provide contact information for employees with flagged contracts\n\n**Next Steps:**\nPlease upload the required Excel files to the `/workspace` folder, then provide your next instruction so I can begin the analysis.\n\nNext request.", "tool_calls": []}, {"user": "Instruction: Since I cannot access the required files and you need to upload them, please proceed to upload contracts.xlsx, revenue_schedule.xlsx, and employee_contracts.xlsx to the /workspace folder through your interface.
