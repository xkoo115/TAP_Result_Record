Here's a comprehensive summary of what was accomplished:\n\n**Sample Data Created:**\n- **Vegetable Categories**: Leafy Vegetables, Root Vegetables, Fruit Vegetables, Legumes, Other Vegetables\n- **2011 Data**: Total of 8,000 operations with realistic distribution\n- **2016 Data**: Total of 9,250 operations showing 15.6% overall growth\n\n**Visualizations Generated:**\n\n1. **2011 Pie Chart** (`/workspace/2011_pie.png`):\n   - Shows percentage distribution of agricultural operations by vegetable category\n   - Fruit Vegetables dominate with 30.6% of operations\n   - Clear color coding for easy category identification\n\n2. **2016 Bar Chart** (`/workspace/2016_bar.png`):\n   - Displays absolute number of operations for each category\n   - Shows growth patterns from 2011 to 2016\n   - Includes value labels on bars and grid for readability\n\n**Key Insights from Sample Data:**\n- **Fruit Vegetables** had the highest number of operations in both years (2,450 in 2011, 2,850 in 2016)\n- **Legumes** had the lowest number of operations (950 in 2011, 1,100 in 2016)\n- **Overall Growth**: 15.6% increase in total operations from 2011 to 2016\n- **Growth Patterns**: All categories showed positive growth ranging from 13.5% to 16.7%\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n- Used matplotlib for professional-quality visualizations\n- Applied consistent color schemes across both charts\n- Included proper labeling, titles, and formatting\n- Saved both charts as high-resolution PNG files (300 DPI)\n\nThe visualizations successfully demonstrate the agricultural operations distribution across vegetable crop categories for both years, with the pie chart providing a proportional view for 2011 and the bar chart showing absolute values and growth for 2016.\n\nNext request.",
